## Echo

This is a subproject of [**Mergen IV**](https://github.com/fulcrum6378/mergen_android)
in Python which helps with faster debugging of sound recognition algorithms.
These methods are translated to C++ for the main project.
Echo was initiated at 3 November 2023, 04:20.

After much confusion until 28 December 2023, I concluded that AUD and HPT don't need their data to be pre-processed
in order to enter the subconscious mind (SCM), therefore I decided to archive Echo!!
